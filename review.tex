\paragraph{Modeling}

\textit{Urban growth modeling literature.}

\cite{bonin2012modele} emergence of qualitatively different urban functions ; based on Alonso-Muth model.

\cite{makse1998modeling} : model of urban growth involving urban form (here the local spatial correlations induce urban structure)
